# File layout of an QMK firmware
Your keyboard should be located in qmk_firmware/keyboards/ and the folder name should be your keyboardâ€™s name as described in the previous section. Inside this folder should be several files:
* readme.md
* info.json
* config.h
* rules.mk
* <keyboard_name>.c
* <keyboard_name>.h
To make QMK automatic adding these file for you, follow this [instruction](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/cli_commands?id=qmk-new-keyboard):
```
qmk new-keyboard
```
Then just follow the promt to finish creating new keyboard. The new-keyboard gonna be included with _readme.md, info.json, config.h, rules.mk_ and a default folder with _keymap.c_. Your next step is to manually adding _<keyboard_name>.c_ and _<keyboard_name>.h_.
# readme.md
This file is for guest and even for maker to explain his/her firmware, or to documents the journey.
# info.json 
This file is used by the [QMK API](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_api). It contains the information QMK Configurator needs to display a representation of your keyboard. You can also set metadata here. For more information see the [REFERENCE PAGE](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/reference_info_json).

	"board": "BLACKPILL_STM32_F411",
    "diode_direction": "COL2ROW",
